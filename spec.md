Project Overview
Build a full-stack AI Operations Automation Platform called Agentic AI Automation Platform (Agentflow_AI) that lets operators describe an automation in natural language and turn it into an executable visual workflow. The platform must generate workflow graphs from prompts, render those graphs on a drag-and-drop canvas, execute them through a chain of cooperating AI agents, integrate with real third-party tools (Gmail, Slack, Discord, Google Sheets) over OAuth, queue and retry background jobs, stream live execution events to the browser, and persist a full timeline of every step for auditing.

Tech Stack
Frontend uses Next.js (Pages Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Axios, React Flow (@xyflow/react), Socket.IO client, and lucide-react icons. Backend uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JSON Web Tokens, BullMQ on Redis (via ioredis), Socket.IO, helmet, morgan, compression, express-validator, and bcryptjs. AI integration is done through the OpenRouter API and the Google Generative AI SDK, with LangChain and LangGraph available for agentic orchestration. OAuth and bot integrations cover Gmail, Slack, Discord, and Google Sheets. Sensitive credentials are encrypted at rest with an application-level key.

Core Features
Authentication
The authentication system must support registration, login, JWT-based session handling, protected routes, an /auth/me profile endpoint, role separation between admin and operator, password hashing with bcrypt at cost 12, and persistent login state on the client through Zustand.

Workflow Management
For workflow management, users must be able to create workflows manually, generate workflows from a natural-language prompt, list and search their workflows, open any workflow on a React Flow canvas, drag nodes from a palette, configure each node through a side panel, save, duplicate, version, and delete workflows, and trigger executions on demand. Every workflow stores its nodes, edges, trigger configuration, tags, and version number.

Agentic Orchestration
For agentic execution, the backend must run each workflow through a fixed chain of agents: a planner agent that decides the node ordering and emits a confidence score, an execution agent that runs each node against the correct integration or AI provider, a validation agent that verifies required output fields, a recovery agent that classifies failures (MISSING_FIELDS, API_FAILURE, AUTH_EXPIRED, RATE_LIMIT, TRANSIENT) and decides between retry_with_backoff and escalate, and a monitoring agent that emits timeline events. LangGraph must be importable as the orchestration substrate, and the orchestrator must report langGraph: 'available' | 'not-installed' with each run.

Third-Party Integrations
The integrations layer must support Gmail (send and read mail), Slack (post messages and subscribe to events), Discord (post bot messages), and Google Sheets (append rows and read ranges). Each provider must support an OAuth start endpoint, an OAuth callback endpoint, and a connected/disconnected status. Access tokens and refresh tokens must be encrypted at rest using CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY. The connection state must be visible from the integrations page, and a missing or expired credential must surface as a clear INTEGRATION_NOT_CONNECTED or AUTH_EXPIRED error in the execution timeline rather than a silent failure.

Execution Engine
For execution, the backend must persist every run as an Execution document with one of PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, RETRYING, PAUSED, or CANCELLED status, record the workflow snapshot at run time, capture input, output, error, duration, and retry count, and write one ExecutionLog row per agent event. Users must be able to pause, resume, and cancel a running execution. BullMQ on Redis must handle background scheduling and retry backoff, with an in-memory fallback when Redis is not configured.

AI Workflow Generation
For AI workflow generation, the user submits a prompt and the system must return a complete workflow with named nodes, positions, edges, and per-node configuration. The generator must prefer OpenRouter when OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set, fall back to Google Gemini when GEMINI_API_KEY is set, and fall back to a deterministic rule-based builder when neither is available. The deterministic builder must still produce a runnable graph for common prompts (send email, invoice routing, Slack/Discord notification, sheet append). The available node catalog is grouped into triggers, actions, AI nodes, and logic nodes.

Real-Time Layer
The Socket.IO server must broadcast agent events (planner, execution, validation, recovery, monitoring) for each execution to subscribed clients, and the client must render those events as a live timeline. Notifications generated during execution (success, failure, escalation) must persist and appear in a notifications drawer.

Complete Specification - Frontend Pages
The application uses the Next.js Pages Router. The root / page redirects authenticated users to the dashboard and unauthenticated users to login.

Complete Specification - Backend Architecture and Database Collections
Backend Architecture
The routes layer handles HTTP routing, request validation via express-validator, and middleware composition (auth, validation, error handler). The controllers layer handles request parsing and response shaping only - it never talks to Mongo directly. The services layer owns business logic: workflow CRUD, execution lifecycle, integration token management, retry classification, notification creation, AI generation, and log aggregation. The agents layer holds the planner, execution, validation, recovery, monitoring, and orchestrator modules. The integrations layer wraps each third-party SDK behind a common interface defined in baseIntegration.js. The queues layer wraps BullMQ and Redis. The config layer centralizes environment loading, Mongo connection (with in-memory fallback), and Socket.IO bootstrapping.

UI and UX Requirements
The UI must use a clean operator-console aesthetic with Tailwind, be fully responsive, include loading states and skeleton loaders, render the workflow graph with React Flow including animated edges, support drag-from-palette node creation, surface a right-hand configuration panel for any selected node, render live execution events in a timeline with color-coded agent badges (planner / execution / validation / recovery / monitoring), and provide a notifications drawer accessible from the AppShell.

Security Requirements
The application must hash passwords with bcrypt at cost 12, sign and verify JWTs with JWT_SECRET, encrypt OAuth access and refresh tokens at rest with CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY, set HTTP security headers via helmet, apply CORS limited to CLIENT_URL, rate-limit auth endpoints via express-rate-limit, validate every request body with express-validator, never log decrypted tokens, and treat any missing or expired credential as an explicit INTEGRATION_NOT_CONNECTED / AUTH_EXPIRED error rather than a generic 500.

Final Expected Outcome
The completed platform must let an operator describe an automation in plain English, watch it materialize as a graph on the canvas, save it, execute it through the agent chain, see each agent event stream in real time, recover or escalate failures automatically, and receive notifications - all backed by real OAuth integrations and a full audit trail in MongoDB. The final application should feel like a modern operations console - close in spirit to n8n or Zapier, but with an explicit agentic execution layer on top.

Codex Implementation Instructions
The AI coding agent must build the application phase by phase, follow the folder structure strictly, keep controllers thin and push logic into services, keep agents pure (no HTTP knowledge), wrap every integration behind the baseIntegration interface, never call Mongo from a controller, never call an integration from an agent without going through the integration service, treat every secret as process.env, use the in-memory store fallback when Mongo or Redis is unavailable so local dev still works, emit a Socket.IO event for every agent step, write one ExecutionLog per agent event, and report the list of files created or changed at the end of every phase. Implementation priorities are correctness of the agent chain, integration safety, real-time observability, scalability, and clean architecture.
